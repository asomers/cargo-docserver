# cargo-docserver - exposes your crate docs in a built-in http server

This is just the result of me fooling around with what would be the minimal HTTP server for this. This is not security-vetted, you've been warned. Use only for development, if you're feeling brave

## usage:

cargo docserver -p <port>


### sidenote

I've tried really hard to find a simple embeddable rust static file server, if you happen to stumble into one, let me know!
